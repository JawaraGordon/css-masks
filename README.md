# Color Mask Morph

## A JavaScript application that allows you to change the background color with a custom widget, pick from a list of mask shapes, change the shape color with a hex value, then add an image URL mask layer.

### Features

- This app is built using custom functions that listen for changes on the form drop-down and sanitized inputs.
- The functions work together to apply the correct SVG mask to the image and color of your choosing.
- You can and an image URL address (ending in .jpg or .png format) to create a mask layer on top of an image. (transparent PNG files work best)
- Use the color picker widget to instantly change the background color while generating a hex code value that can be copied to the shape color input field.
- Available shapes are: circle, square,triangle, diamond, pentagon, hexagon, octagon and star.
