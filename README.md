# Mask Shape Picker

## A JavaScript / CSS tool that allows you to pick from a list of mask shapes and apply them to different hex-colored backgrounds.

### Features

- The tool is built using two custom functions that listen for changes on the form drop-down and input.
- The functions work together to apply the correct SVG mask to the color of your choosing.
